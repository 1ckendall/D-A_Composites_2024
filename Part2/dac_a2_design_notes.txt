1) Monocoque- Aluminum (same thickness --> variable thickness (iterative))
--Yielding (use von Mises criterion)
--Thin sheet (shell) buckling. If not, flat sheet.
--Do not consider: Inter-rivet buckling, cutouts, stiffeners, joints, etc


2) Composite Monocoque 
--Three different thicknesses. Expect +-45 dominant at midplane. Expect +0 dominant at top/bottom. 
--Black Aluminum design (start with quasi isotropic [90, +-45, 0, 0, -+45, 90] .. match stiffness of aluminum)	
--Failure criterion (Puck) under LPF. Provide M.O.S for a selected design
--Ply drop rules 
---d >= 15*h_drop (lightweight design - lecture 3 pdf slide 14)
---drop middle layers
---drop symmetric (if possible)
---maintain atleast +-45


3) Stiffened Composite
--T-stiffener (lower flange: 0 dominanted and match layup of skin; web +-45)
--stiffener positioning
	option 1) increase stiffener area at top/bottom regions of fuselage, AND/OR
	option 2) reduce stiffener spacing at top/bottom regions of fuselage
--consider: global column (euler?) buckling (stiffener), local crippling (stiffener- flange/web) -One Edge Free/No Edge Free boundary conditions, local sheet buckling (skin- assume flat panel)
---slide 3, lecture 3 => increase D66 to increase critical buckling load ((1) increase +-45 away from midplane, (2)increase the laminate height))
--do not consider: global stiffened panel buckling, interrivet, panel breaker condition, skin-stiffener separation

Notes from CK's slides:

L1 (intro):
Material failure, column buckling, crippling
Expect 30% weight reduction when you go from quasi isotropic to symmetric (B =0 ), balanced (A16=A26=0), directional, no twisting/bending coupling (D16=D26=0)

L2 (stress PDEs):
--Plate is sufficiently long and wide so solution is not affected by boundary proximity
--he re-states fundamental stress-strain mechanics
--he solves PDEs using potential functions
--conclusion of mathematicale exercise: 
	---Axial stresses in (0/90)4 panels decay more slowly (require longer doublers) than (±45)4 or [(±45)/(0/90)]s panels
	---On the other hand, transverse and shear stresses in (±45)4 or [(±45)/(0/90)]s panels are more critical than in (0/90)4 	panels
	---Preliminary doubler (reinforcement dimensions): ℓ=0.5a for (0/90)4 and 0.3a for (±45)4 or [(±45)/(0/90)]s panels and w=	0.3b for all panels
--skip plate under point load
--biaxial loading
--For the same thickness, aluminum has 10-20% higher buckling load (depending on AR)
To increase the buckling load of the composite by 20% need to increase the thickness by a factor (1.2)1/3= 1.063 or 6.3%
--Buckling under shear => generalised eigenvalue problems
--slide 61 > N0
--slide 62 > pure compression, N0 simplifies 
--slide 70 > curve for buckling interaction


L3 (buckling):
--slide 6,7 > NASA solutions for various buckling loads and BCs
--slide 10 > in general buckling does not imply failure especially for plates. Allowing PB will mean you need to show correct calculations that say you have enough margin.	
--Post buckling
---Skin buckling as a whole (stiffeners only increase the bending stiffness of the skin)
---Skin buckling between the bays (stiffeners act as panel breakers)
---Stiffeners buckle as columns or locally (crippling)
preferred PB:
---Skin between stiffeners and frames buckles first
---Stiffeners do not buckle and do not move out of plane (depending on cross-section they may rotate => BC implications)
---When required PB value is reached, skin fails in compression and/or stiffeners fail by crippling

--effective width determination

+- 45 outside (in case of impact) => symmetric
