Verification performed on Lamina and Laminate class. ABD matrix incorrect.

-Initial Problem:
--Ex was increasing with theta
-Corrections:
--defined z from midplane (it was initially defined from bottom plane)
--array correction (plylist array was being appended instead of overwritten at every loop)


-A matrix is still incorrect. It was cross-checked against an online calculator.
--A matrix incorrect due to incorrect computation of Qbarmat
--Qmat was correctly implemented 
--z-positions of the laminae correctly implemented
--triple-checked algebraic expressions of Qbarmat
--computed Qbarmat with transformation matrix
--in lamina class, Qbarmat computed with algebraic expressions matches with multiplication with transformation/inv. transformation  matrix 
--HOWEVER, Qbarmat is still incorrect. Thus, A is still incorrect.
--checked that m is cos, n is sin
--Nachos wrote a quick, dirty script to implement ABD matrices (w/o functions and w/o classes). Q,A, ABD matrices match with online calculator.

Final verdict: error on conversion from deg to rad
